# Xanderstrike Web Projects

This repository contains all of my various websites. Each directory is built into a tag of the `xanderstrike/web` Docker container.

## Structure

- Each subdirectory represents a separate website project.
- The contents of each directory are copied into a Docker image tag.

## Example

- The `astandke/` directory is built into the Docker image `xanderstrike/web:astandke`.

## Usage

To build and run a specific website, navigate to the desired directory and use Docker commands to build and run the container.
